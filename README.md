# image-widget-demo

> simple demo of widgets for image data

The included Jupyter notebook shows two examples of using widgets to dynamically update image properties and then show the images. A common experience is that, while super useful, this can be slow, especially for large images. The goal of this exercise is to better understand the performance limitations in this setup, and explore possible avenues for performance improvements.
